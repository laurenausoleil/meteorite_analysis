# Meteorite Landings

This project cleans and analyses NASA data for meteorite landings recorded between 1583 and 2013. 

It was created as practice during my Data Analysis training with CodeClan in December 2020.

You can explore the cleaned data as you wish or read the Meteorite Data Analysis document to see my analysis.

In order to run the Analysis locally, you will need R and the tidyverse package.
